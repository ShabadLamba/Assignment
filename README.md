# NOTE

- Did everything listed in the requirements
- Implemented Login using very basic jwt methid at Backend and frontend but it doesn't presists after page reload.
- Didn't use NgRx to manage state because seemed overkill and also was taking more time than 5 hours
- Also, only implemented Unit testing only for a few functions in the servces and didn't do it for any componets.
- To setup do : npm i
- To start the project use: npx nx serve api and npx nx serve suite-portal
